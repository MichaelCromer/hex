A command-line hexworld/crawl builder with a TUI and modal editing.

executable is `./build/hex` for you to use as you see fit.

## Features

### DONE

 - [X] navigate tiles
 - [X] paint terrain, roads, rivers, and map features

### IN PROGRESS

 - [ ] panels on the left for map detail info, panels on the right for help

### Roadmap to 1.0

Definite targets

 - [ ] consistent UI/UX
     - - [ ] 'j' _always_ toggles view of tile detail
     - - [ ] directional keys _always_ move the reticule
     - - [ ] 'await'-style modes return to previous mode afterwards
 - [ ] expanded commands and options
     - - [ ] '?' for contextual help/commands, :h[elp] for more in-depth help viewer
     - - [ ] repeat/undo last action
 - [ ] full/adaptive colour

### Midterm Goals

Subject to change

 - [ ] minimap overlay option [looking doubtful if next point happens]
 - [ ] map layer changes using logtree structure for rapid traversal
 - [ ] naming of map features / customisable map data
 - [ ] searchable locations
 - [ ] single tile focus deep zoom
 - [ ] set/goto map marks

### Longterm Goals

Completely uncertain

 - [ ] `hex --crawl` option for 'player' mode
 - [ ] location zoom. dungeon/settlement layout painting
 - [ ] other fantasy ttrpg elements: items, monsters, npcs?
 - [ ] calendar, seasons
