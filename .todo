[X] Implement tundra terrain
[ ] Migrate panel and draw to use windows/screens.
[ ] UI: input mode indicator in bottom
[ ] UI: terrain mode panel resize/reshape?
[ ] UX: reticule changes colour based on input mode
[ ] UX different brush sizes
[ ] UX remember last placed terrain
[ ] UX drag-paint doesn't update last placed terrain?
[ ] update splash
[ ] 'soft'/oneshot vs 'hard'/locked input mode (like 't' vs 'T' for terrain entry)
[ ] decide on state manager handling all update vs action model
[ ] main.c L53  this is ridiculous as written here 
[ ] main.c L55  def an appropriate length 
[ ] main.c L121 remove magic numbers and have a geometry_initialise that takes a screen 
[ ] main.c L127 remove the jank, make it reference a geometry 
[ ] grid.c L81  separate struct Tile containing all terrain-like data, for nullability 
[ ] grid.c L411 a map-native implementation of map_insert 
[ ] grid.c L440 a map-natrve implementation of map_create_neighbours
